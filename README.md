# Web Development Assignment vol. 1
# W36

This repository contains solutions to several exercises designed to practice and enhance your web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of web development, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and using LocalStorage.

## Frontend Exercises: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

1. **Show / Hide Message on Hover**: Learn how to show and hide elements using `mouseover` and `mouseout` events to manipulate CSS classes.

2. **Todo List Example**: Build a simple to-do list application where you can add items to a list and remove them by clicking on them.

3. **Mr. Duck Website**: Create a playful webpage featuring "Mr. Duck" where users can input messages, interact with an Easter egg hover effect, and save messages using LocalStorage.

4. **Dropdown List with Item Toggle**: Implement a dropdown menu that adds or removes items from a list when selected.

## Backend Exercises: JavaScript
### Functions & Objects

1. **Create Basic Functions**: Write simple JavaScript functions to print names, calculate the area of a rectangle, and calculate distance based on speed and time.
2. **Attach Functions to an Object**: Create a `calculator` object and attach the above functions to it.

### Class Exercises

1. **Cat Class**: Create a `Cat` class with properties like `name`, `color`, and `breed`, and methods to get and change the cat's name.

### Car Class Exercise

1. **Car Class**: Define a `Car` class with properties (`make`, `model`, `year`) and methods to get car info, start, and stop the car. Test these methods using different car instances.

### Array Exercises

1. **Manipulate Arrays**: Practice array operations like finding an element, adding new elements, and slicing arrays.
2. **Objects in Arrays**: Create objects, add them to arrays, and manipulate them.

### Arrays & Objects

1. **Student Grades Management**: Create a `Student` object to manage grades. Write functions to add grades and update the student's name.

## Frontend Exercises Overview
This overview covers exercises on DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and asynchronous JavaScript.

- Add a timestamp to messages (format: `DD/MM/YYYY, hh:mm`).
- Use the `title` attribute on HTML elements for hover text.

## Forms Exercise
- Add a "User" button in the header (top-right corner) linking to `user.html`.
- Create a form for user creation:
  - Include fields like "Name" to avoid repetitive pop-ups.
  - Add JavaScript validation with custom error messages.

## Async Exercise
- Add a "Force Answer" button next to "Mr. Duck" in the header.
- Use fetch, async/await, and event listeners to make "Mr. Duck" respond with jokes.

## Email Validation Exercise
- Implement custom JavaScript validation for emails ending with `@cphbusiness.dk`.

## Local Storage Exercise
- Save the user's name in `localStorage` when using the "Send" button.
- Load the user's name from `localStorage` on page load.

## Extra Exercises
- Complete the user page with conditional validation and display error messages.
- Add a delay to Mr. Duck's jokes for better timing.
- Implement a profanity filter for user input using string matching.

## Backend Exercises Overview
This overview covers exercises on JavaScript basics like loops, arrays, objects, functions, and simple game logic.

## 1. Loops & Arrays
- Create an array with mixed data types.
- Loop through the array to log each element's type.

## 2. Loops & Objects
- Create an array of book objects (`title`, `author`).
- Use JavaScript to add each book to a `<ul>` on an HTML page.

## 3. Functions
- **findLargest**: Return the largest of four numbers.
- **Range Check**: Check if a number is within a range.

## 4. Repository Exercise
- Clone a git repo.
- Display numbers 1-20 on a webpage, style even/odd, and highlight on click.
